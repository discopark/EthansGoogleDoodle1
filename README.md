The internet and stock market are aflame over GameStop, the video game retailer whose stock is suddenly the darling of day traders who are putting the squeeze on Wall Street’s big players.

The stakes are enormous: The surge in trading drove GameStop’s value up by more than \$10 billion on Wednesday alone. On Thursday, as several trading platforms temporarily placed restrictions on the stock, the shares slid 44 percent, only to soar again on Friday after the trading restrictions were eased.

Exactly why GameStop’s value — on paper, at least — has rocketed to stratospheric levels has to do with a mix of traditional investing, rampant enthusiasm, stock market mechanics and the belief that anyone with a Robinhood account can meme a fortune into existence.

What’s going on?
It’s called a short squeeze, and it involves investors betting on which way a stock will go — up or down. These bets are placed by buying the shares themselves, or stock options, which we’ll grossly oversimplify here.

Investors who bet against a stock are called “shorts.” In GameStop’s case, the shorts include at least two big hedge funds.
